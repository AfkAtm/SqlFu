#Welcome to SqlFu

SqlFu is a  dapper fast micro-orm (like dapper.net, peta poco , massive etc) for .Net 4.  

## Why should you use it
The main USP (unique selling proposition - advantage) of SqlFu  is  **Versatility**. This is the reason I've developed it. I need it more flexibility and the micro-orm I was using (peta poco) didn't have it and if other micro-orms had it, they were too slow (FluentData). 

I've designed SqlFu based on three equally important principles:
 User Friendliness (intuitivity) | Versatility |  Performance
 
 **What SqlFu is**:  Fast library built on top of Ado.Net to help you reduce the amount of coding by hand. You still have to write Sql, but you won't have to deal with repetitive chores.
 
 **What SqlFu is NOT**: A replacement for any ORM abstracting sql or generating DDL for you.
